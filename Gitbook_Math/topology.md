# Topology

## Introduction

Algebraic topology is a study of shapes and their properties independent of continuous deformation.

## One Dimensional Objects

A line is a typical one dimensional object, going to the infinity on both directions straightly. Obviously, a line is polymorphic to a curve. When a straight line becomes bent somehow, it is called “deformed”. Similarly, a circle may be deformed into any closed curve.

There are different ways to interpret lines/curves. Here is a circle example.

1. Variety/Coordinates

$$
x^2+y^2=1
$$

2. Curve/Trajectory of a Particle,
   1. transcendental parametrization.

$$
\rho(\theta)=(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)
$$

   2. rational parametrization

$$
e(h)=(\frac{1-h^2}{1+h^2},\frac{2h}{1+h^2}),e(\infty)=(-1,0)
$$

3. Modulized Space, a space of possibilities

For subspaces of a 2 dimensional space, they are the same things as lines throw the origin. Each subspace intersect the circle at a unique point.

The space of all 1 dimensional subspaces is a circle, $P^1$, which consists of the projective lines or lines through the origin. There is $P^1\simeq S^1$.

4. A circle is a loop of string/rope in 3 dimensional space.
